%% 1
magn = abs(7+24j);
ipow = j^(j^j);
isec = asec(5- j);
pos_root = (-(-4)+sqrt((-4)^2 -(4*5*-3)))/(2*5);
E = [magn ipow isec pos_root]

%% 2
A = [ real(E(2)) real(E(3)) ; imag(E(2)) imag(E(3)) ; abs(E(2)) abs(E(3)) ; angle(E(2)) angle(E(3))  ]

%% 3
B = mean(A,2)

%% 4
A + B;
%A + B adds each column of A with the value of its respective row in the
%column vector B. This is done through a a broadcast of B to allow it to be added to A by traditional matrix addition.

A + 1;
%This performs elementwise addition, adding 1 to each element of the
%matrix. This is done through  a broadcast of 1 to allow it be added by A
%by traditional matrix addition.

%A+E;
%This is invalid as the matrixes sizes are incompotable as E is a row
%vector of 1x4 with attempted to be added with the a 4x2 matrix. No
%broadcast is taking place

%% 5
reg_transp = transpose(A)*B %(a)
elem_sub = B - 3 %(b)
C = repmat(A,1,2) %(c)
reg_tranpd = C - A*transpose(A) %(d)
elem_multc = C.*C %(e)
elem_multd = C.^2 %(f)
c_squared = C^2 %(g)
D = eye(4)   
trace_h = trace(C-D)    %(h)

%% 6
vec_1 = linspace(pi,exp(1),1000);
vec_2 = 0:1/(7*10^6):2;
